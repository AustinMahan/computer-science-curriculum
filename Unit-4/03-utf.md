# UTF

Unfortunately, ASCII does not cover a large amount of special characters, so we use a character encoding called UTF-8. UTF-8 has become the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web, accounting for 81.4% of all Web pages in November 2014 (with most popular East Asian encoding at 1.4% and all of them combined under 5%). The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) recommends that all e-mail programs be able to display and create mail using UTF-8.[5] The W3C recommends UTF-8 as default encoding in their main standards (XML and HTML).

Here is what a UTF table looks like - [http://www.utf8-chartable.de/](http://www.utf8-chartable.de/)
