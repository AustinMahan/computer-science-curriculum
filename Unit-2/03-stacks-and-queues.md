# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

[Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) - when both insertion and removal happen from the same end we call this a LIFO (last-in-first-out) structure.

You can think of a stack simply as some items stacked on top of each other just like these cups!

### Examples

Where do we see stacks in the real world?

- How about the [call stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack)?
- The 'undo' command in a text editor can be modeled with a stack.
- We use stacks to help in the implementation of more complex data structures and algorithms
- A stack is an extremely useful and efficient data structure for solving algorithms like figuring out a palindrome.
- Typical application areas include compilers, operating systems, handling of program memory (nested function calls)


## Queues

[Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) - when insertion must happen from rear/tail end of queue and removal must happen from front/head, we call this a FIFO (first-in-first-out) structure.

A Queue is list or collection with the restriction that insertion can be performed at one end and deletion can be performed at the other front

Queue operations - (all [O(1) / Constant Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Constant_time)):
- insertion - enqueue/push/insert
- deletion -  dequeue/pop/remove/delete
- front/peek - find the head element (just return the element at front)
- isEmpty - check if empty
- IsFull - if there is a limited size

### Examples

Where do we use queues?

- Batch processing: For operations where various entities are stored and held to be processed later, the queue performs the function of a buffer.
- Typical application areas include print job scheduling, operating systems (process scheduling).

And remember, the regular Array structure in Javascript is a Stack (first in, last out) and can also be used as a Queue (first in, first out) depending on the calls you make.

## Exercises

* [Data Structures in JS](https://github.com/gSchool/data-structures-js)
* If you've implemented linked lists already, modify them to create implementations for stacks and queues.
