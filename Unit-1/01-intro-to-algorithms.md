# Algorithms

An algorithm is a well defined, step by step computational procedure for solving a problem.

Algorithms are:

- Deterministic - they have a goal
	- They terminate at some point in time.
- They take input
- They produce output

In this unit we will explore several common algorithms and learn about their complexities.
