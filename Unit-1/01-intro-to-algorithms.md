# Intro to Algorithms

An [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) is a well defined, step by step computational procedure for solving a problem.

Algorithms:

- have a goal ([deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system)),
- terminate at some point in time,
- take an input, and
- produce output.

In this unit we will explore several common algorithms and learn about their complexities.
