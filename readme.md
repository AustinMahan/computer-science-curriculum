# Computer Science Curriculum

Computer Science is important because it's better to understand something based on [first, basic principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-s_3b5fRd8&t=22m38s). Before you dive in, you should know a few things.

1. These are fascinating topics that I really hope you enjoy learning about. It's hard, but totally worth it!
2. Most of this will be useful in the job interview process.
3. You don't need a computer science degree to learn about computer science.

Finally, I think it's appropriate to take 10 minutes to explore the history of computer science and programming in general with the [Art of Writing Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdVFvsCWXrA).
